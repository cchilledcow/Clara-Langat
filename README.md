## Project title 
Cyberguard: A phishing awareness challenge 

## Project vision 
This a phishing awareness challenge designed to educate and engage:
- General Users: Anyone interested in enhancing their phishing awareness and skills.
- Employees within Organizations: This can of value to organizations in training their employee in understanding common - tactics used and how to mitigate them.
- Students: This can be an engaging and interactive way for students to learn about phishing concepts.


The web-based application is divided into two parts, each designed to cater to different levels of cybersecurity awareness and expertise.
In the first part, users are introduced to the fundamentals of phishing through interactive slides and mock email simulations. This part is aimed at educating users about the common phishing tactics and provide practical tips for identifying suspicious communications. Users can then test their knowledge by differentiating genuine emails from phishing attempts in a simulated environment.
The second part of the project uses artificial intelligence technology, specifically OpenAI's GPT- 4  API, to generate realistic email communications. Users are tasked with distinguishing between genuine communications and simulated phishing attempts.
