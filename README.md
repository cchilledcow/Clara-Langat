## Project title 
Security-awareness-game

## Project vision 
I intend on creating a web-based security awareness game designed to educate and engage:
-	General Users: Anyone interested in enhancing their cybersecurity awareness and skills.
-	Employees within Organizations: A valuable training tool for organizations to improve employee cybersecurity knowledge.
-	Students: An engaging and interactive way for students to learn about cybersecurity concepts and best practices.

The web-based platform will feature a collection of mini-games, each addressing a specific cybersecurity topic or scenario. The mini games are designed to be engaging, informative, and suitable for players of all skill levels. They cover a range of cybersecurity concepts.

## Risk Plan
#### Technical Challenges:
-	Programming Errors: A few coding mistakes or bugs could affect the game's functionality.
-	Compatibility Issues: There might be problems with game elements not working as intended on certain devices or browsers.

#### Content Development:
-	Content Creation Delays: There might be delays in developing the game content, the series of mini games.

#### User experience:
-	Feedback Implementation: There might be challenges in incorporating player feedback and improvements.


To manage these risks effectively, I will follow these strategies:
-	Develop a clear project plan with well-defined milestones and deadlines.
-	Regularly back up the project work and documentation.
-	Continuously test the game with potential users to gather feedback and address usability issues.
-	Seek guidance and feedback from project supervisors and professors.
-	Create a testing plan to identify and resolve compatibility issues.
